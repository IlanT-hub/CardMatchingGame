# CardMatchingGame
Description:
The Card Matching Game is an interactive memory puzzle game developed in Java using Swing and AWT libraries. Players flip cards attempting to match identical pairs. The game tracks the number of tries and provides visual feedback, including a congratulatory message upon successful completion.

How It Works:

Cards are shuffled randomly each game.
Clicking on a card reveals its front image. Two cards can be flipped at a time.
If the two cards match, they're disabled and stay face-up. Otherwise, they flip back over.
The game tracks player progress, counting tries and checking for game completion.
My Process:

Planned the game's logic: shuffle cards, event handling for clicks, card matching logic.
Created a GUI using Java Swing, providing visual elements (cards, images, and dialogs).
Implemented the main gameplay loop and debugged interactions between the graphical components and game logic.
Enhanced user experience with smooth animations and intuitive feedback.
Technologies Used:

Java, Swing, AWT
